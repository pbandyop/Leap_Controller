Absolute and Relative pointing using Leap Motion.

This project was done as a part of the "Interface Technology" course conducted in University of Helsinki. This project shows an application that can be used as a research tool to compare the ease of use between absolute pointing and relative pointing using Leap Motion Controller. It captures the quantifiable data in order to assess the effectiveness of different pointing techniques using a Leap Motion Controller. The application consists of four colored circles and four target circles. The user needs to select the colored circles one at a time and drag it to the respective target circles. The same task has to be done for both the pointing modes. For comparing the ease of use, we display the time a single user takes to complete the whole task, in each pointing mode.

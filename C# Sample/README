
1. Set up your Leap motion device. Follow this awesome guide: https://www.leapmotion.com/getting-started
2. Download the Leap Motion SDK from here: https://developer.leapmotion.com/
3. Extract the folder. You will find the sample C# application in a location: LeapSDK/samples/Sample.cs 
4. Create a working project directory at any location. For example, let us create a directory 'LeapDev' in E drive.
5. Copy Sample.cs & LeapCSharp.NET4.0 dll in that directory.
6. Open the Developer command prompt.
7. Type in the command: csc /reference:LeapCSharp.NET4.0.dll /platform:x86 /target:exe Sample.cs. This will create a Sample.exe executible. Copy Leap.dll and LeapCSharp.dll in the directory where Sample.exe is generated.
8. Connect the Leap motion, start the leap motion service and run the Sample.exe from command prompt. Enjoy the interaction.
9. Go through the sample application source code to understand how it works.
